Initial ideas for how to utilize my coding/programming skills:
The goal is to become a full stack developer.
I also want to branch into game development. 
Tell stories through building games/then hosting my games in an app. Allowing the world to subscribe to my series of games through the app.
I also worked as an LPN for the last 5 years, mostly in nursing homes. They could use help simplifying their software, so that they can have more patient to nurse interactions.
A simple website that you put in your main protein, then it gives you a choice of 2-3 ingredients recipes, 4-5 ingredients recipes, or a full out impress your dinner guests category. With a favorite tab for people to just go to their favorites.
I want to make a few MOOC's for personal finance, rent vs owning, how to retire early the legit way without losing purpose (the trick is to find work that you love and learn budgeting), how to plan for your future and make it obtainable.
Self therapy game.
